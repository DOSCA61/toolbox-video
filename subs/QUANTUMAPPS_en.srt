case, you just walk through the 32 00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,680 steps and respond to everything in the affirmative. 33 00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,840 It will then bring you back to this 34 00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,120 point, and you just press the install button. 35 00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,520 The app's been installed. 36 00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,660 We'll now open the app. 37 00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,620 When the app is opened, it will ask 38 00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,680 you to register your device, and to do 39 00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,100 that, just simply press the

that button. 46 00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,080 I've sent the email. 47 00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,830 It then asks you f-... 48 00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,479 to allow the RasCore app access to th- 49 00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,000 this device location. 50 00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,800 We want the precise location, and we want 51 00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,580 it while using the app. 52 00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,630 We now want to allow access all of 53 00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,900 the time. 54 00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,420 We will then select the back arrow at 55 00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,560 the top left of the page. 56 00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,760 We'll now confirm that we will allow RasCore 57 00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,260 to send notifications. 58 00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,820 Device has now been registered, and the system 59 00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,420 should pick up your current location. 60 00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,410 If you're on RasLo-... 61 00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,800 RasCore location, you should see the current location. 62 00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,950 If you do not see that, then if 63 00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,620 you look down the bottom left-hand corner, uh, 64 00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,320 on that dark bar, you will see settings. 65 00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,280 But as we can see, in this case, 66 00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,280 the location has been found, and that's perfect. 67 00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,720 So, we will now close that app. 68 00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,360 Go back to our emails. 69 00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,280 Now we're looking for the invitation to join 70 00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,660 RasCore Site Attendance, so we're going to select 71 00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,320 that. 72 00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,060 And to register for the Site Attendance portal, 73 00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,340 we will click on the create new password. 74 00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,960 Now, we like to use a standard password, 75 00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,460 so if anybody's in trouble, we can quickly 76 00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,280 help you. 77 00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,840 And that password is percent percent bloom one 78 00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,100 two three percent percent. 79 00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,080 We'll re-enter that password, just quickly check that 80 00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,780 they're the same, and then we confirm. 81 00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:07,860 This now launches the RasCore Site Attendance SPA 82 00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,440 application. 83 00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,140 And you simply take a photograph of your 84 00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,860 SPA and submit. 85 00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,440 What we'll also do now is create a 86 00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,640 shortcut to this app on your phone by 87 00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,520 selecting the down arrow button. 88 00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,690 And we can see that a question's popped 89 00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,220 up, "Add this website to the apps screen?" 90 00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,420 So we're going to add that. 91 00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:32,820 Okay. 92 00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,800 We can also star this, uh, creating a 93 00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,060 bookmark. 94 00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,300 So that's that app. 95 00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,960 We'll now go to the second app. 96 00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,140 Go back to our emails, and we have 97 00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,840 an invitation there to join Toolbox Talks portal. 98 00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,460 We'll select that. 99 00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,920 As the same process, we'll create a new 100 00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,180 password. 101 00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,840 We'll enter the password again. 102 00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,360 If you keep it standard, percent percent B-L 103 00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,480 bloom one two three percent percent. 104 00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,980 Okay, both are the same. 105 00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,420 We confirm. 106 00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,540 That's brought us into Toolbox Talks. 107 00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,640 So at the moment, there are no Toolbox 108 00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,640 Talks there for you, and that's fine. 109 00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,680 So what we will do now is we 110 00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,840 will add this app to our shortcut as 111 00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,600 well by selecting the down arrow on the 112 00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,920 right-hand side of the screen and select add. 113 00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,580 We can also add this to our bookmarks 114 00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,340 by selecting the star. 115 00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,960 That's the two installed. 116 00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,960 So what we'll now do is we'll send 117 00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,640 an email to the application. 118 00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,520 This will take a minute, so we'll just 119 00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,140 wait. 120 00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,720 So, we've now received the notic- notification from 121 00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,120 the system asking us to complete the Toolbox 122 00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,420 Talk, so we will select the talk, and 123 00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,280 we'll set the link. 124 00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,650 So Toolbox Talks has been scheduled for you. 125 00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,540 Select the link below to access your talks. 126 00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,140 Select the link. 127 00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,780 And there's our talk. 128 00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,540 If we rotate the screen sideways and refresh 129 00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:30,060 that page, we can see that a file 130 00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,080 has been added to this. 131 00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,060 That file is your original familiar format, which 132 00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,560 you can then select that and review it. 133 00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,880 But what we want you to do is 134 00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,460 to confirm that you've read that, um, talk. 135 00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,600 So just tap on "Working in Hot Weather". 136 00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,860 And you can see section one there. 137 00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,820 So, each Toolbox Talk will have up to 138 00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,040 a maximum of seven sections, and what you 139 00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,480 will do is you will confirm that you've 140 00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:55,840 read each section.
